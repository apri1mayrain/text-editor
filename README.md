## Description

This app is a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a single-page application and can also be installed as a [Progressive Web Application (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps). It contains data persistence techniques (IndexedDB) and functions offline (service worker & page and asset caching).

### User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Render
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

## Deployment

## Features

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to execute JavaScript in CLI or *outside* of web browser.
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to implement back-end web framework for routing.
* [Various NPM packages](https://github.com/apri1mayrain/text-editor/blob/main/client/package.json) to create webpack bundle, service worker, cache page and static assets, and retrieve/store text editor content in IndexedDB.
